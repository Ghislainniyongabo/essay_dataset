# Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)

We selected the 20 most affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic and we computed the IFR for three 
months to see the variation of the IFR ration We observed a high variability across countries since there is no consistency.

In United Kingdom, the IFR was lower in the early stages of the outbreak (1.56% for cases up to 10 March)
and one month later, there was an dramatic increase up to 12% for the confirmed cases up to 10 April. 

Despite being the most affected country  with around 496535 covid-19 confirmed cases, the United States recorded an IFR 
ratio 0f just 3% in early April. 

In Italy, the outbreak affected around 10149 cases and the IFR was of 6.21% in the data of 10 March but an increase of confirmed cases up to 147577 , was seen with an a double IFR ration with 12.77% .

The data show also that the IFR ratio from all the countries were not constant which become hard to estimate the number of confirmed cases using the IFR ratio.
