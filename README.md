# Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)

We selected the 20 most affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic and we computed the IFR for three 
months to see the variation of the IFR ration We observed a high variability across countries since there is no consistency.

In United Kingdom, the IFR was lower in the early stages of the outbreak (0,0156 for cases up to 10 March)
and one month later, there was an dramatic increase up to 0,12 for the confirmed cases up to 10 April. 

Despite being the most affected country  with around 496535 covid-19 confirmed cases, the United States recorded an IFR 
ratio 0f just 0,03 in early April. 

In Italy, the outbreak affected around 10149 cases and the IFR was of 0,06 in the data of 10 March but an increase of confirmed cases up to 147577 , was seen with an a double IFR ration with 0,12 .

In general, the data show also that the IFR ratio from all the countries were not constant which become hard to estimate the number of confirmed cases using the IFR ratio.
